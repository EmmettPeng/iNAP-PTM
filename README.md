# iNAP-PTM
Metabolic Modeling Network function: Get Potentially Transferable Metabolites (PTMs)

1. **[bigg_models_metabolites.txt]** Download from http://bigg.ucsd.edu/data_access. It provided the namespace of all bigg collected metabolite ids.

2. **[get_PTM.py]** Modified on the base of https://github.com/mgtools/PhyloMint/blob/master/lib/BuildGraphNetX.py because our results are also from this tool.
